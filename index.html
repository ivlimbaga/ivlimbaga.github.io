        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
        <p>
          <br>I'm Isabella Victoria Limbaga—a Curatorial Associate and project coordinator who thrives at the intersection of creative storytelling and operational precision. I am currently a BA Psychology student at the University of the Philippines Cebu. 
          <br>
          <br>In my current role at Gay-ya Art Consultancy, I focus on making the art world more accessible and organized. Whether I am facilitating educational tours for over 300 visitors or managing complex art inventories and databases 
          for private collectors, my goal is always to strengthen the narrative of the collection while ensuring the logistics are seamless. I’ve also acted as a primary liaison between government agencies and private clients, proving that 
          clear communication is the most effective tool for securing high-impact collaborations.
          <br>
          <br>My professional versatility extends into Human Resources, where I previously served as an assistant at AhCIL Laboratories Inc.. There, I worked directly with executive leadership to overhaul audit processes and modernize the company’s Code of Discipline. 
          These experiences, along with my time in the UP Cebu University Student Council, have shaped me into a leader who can manage records for dozens of official meetings while simultaneously spearheading advocacy campaigns that engage hundreds of people.
          <br>
          <br>I am a firm believer in using the right tools to optimize every workflow. I am highly proficient in Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, Canva, Notion, and Figma; and I am equally comfortable using Asana and Trello to keep projects on track. 
          My technical skills are backed by a commitment to continuous growth, evidenced by my recent certifications in Digital Marketing, E-Commerce, and Persuasive Copywriting.
          <br>
          <br>What truly sets me apart is the dedication to streamlining operations and enhancing team productivity. I look for innovative ways to solve problems and improve service delivery, whether by revamping company audit and accounting flows or optimizing internal documentation. 
          I am searching for a professional environment that values this unique blend of BA Psychology insight, administrative rigor in HR and project coordination, and creative flair in curatorial work—a place where I can continue to bridge the gap between inspired vision and grounded operations.
